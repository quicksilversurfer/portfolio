# Hello World

Thank you for stopping by. 

I'm Prateek, an Interaction Designer at Siemens Healthcare. I am part of small team based in Princeton, NJ, where I work on the design of medical devices and interfaces to improve the user experience and user workflow for healthcare professionals in order to support better outcomes for patients.

During my time here I have had the opportunity to work on the redesign of a M1 market radiology device, and am currently working on creating a UI design system that aims to span across the the Siemens Healthcare product portfolio.

You can find my work experience and education journey below. I'd love to hear from you and you can reach out to me at - hello@prateeksolanki.com.

Cheers! 🍻
